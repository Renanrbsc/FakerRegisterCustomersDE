# FakerRegisterCustomersDE

This system is responsible for generating fake customer data using the Python Faker library. These data are then used to feed a customer class in Python, where they are passed through data validation using regular expressions.

To use the system, it is necessary to have the Faker library installed. It can be installed using the command pip install faker.

The customer class has the following attributes: name, lastname, email, phone, document, age, height, weight and country. These attributes are randomly generated by Faker and then passed through data validation using regular expressions.

The data validation is done through regular expression functions, which check if the generated data is valid. For example, the email validation function checks if the generated email has a valid format (xxx@xxx.xxx).

After validation, the data is stored in a list of tuples, which can be transformed into a Spark DataFrame for data analysis.

Additionally, the validation process also generates boolean columns named 'check_valid_' for each data, indicating whether the data is valid or not.

Once the data is stored in a list of tuples, it can be loaded into a Spark DataFrame for further analysis. To use Spark on a local machine, it is necessary to have Spark and its dependencies installed. This can be done through the command pip install pyspark. Additionally, it is also necessary to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on the local machine.
